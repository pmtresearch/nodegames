    <h1>Instructions of the Trust Game. Please read them carefully</h1>
    <div id="instructions">
      This game is played in rounds by two human players randomly paired.
      <br><br>
      In each round, one of the them, called <em>TRUSTEE</em>, makes an offer to the other player,
      called <em>TRUSTOR</em>, about how to share 100 ECU (Experimental Currency). 100 ECU are equal to 0.05 USD.
      <br><br>
      The TRUSTOR can either accept or reject the offer of the TRUSTEE.
      If he / she accepts, both players split 100 ECU accordingly, else both get 0.
      <br><br>
      The game is repeated 20 rounds, therefore the maximum bonus available is 1 dollar.
      <br><br>
