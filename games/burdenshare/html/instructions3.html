	<h1>Instructions of the experiment. Please read them carefully</h1>
	<div id="instructions">
		You will play four rounds. Each of these rounds is completely independent from the others, and you will start each 
		round again with the same wealth and contribution to climate risk.  The first round is <b>PRACTICE</b>. The subsequent 
		three rounds will be used in the experiment. 
		At the end of the game, you will receive your remaining endowment from one of the last three rounds (in addition to 
		your fixed show-up fee). Which round will be paid out is randomly selected by the computer at the end of the game. 
		For your payout, 50 ECU equal 1 USD.
		<br />
		<br />
		After the game, there will be a short questionnaire. Your payment does not depend on your answers in the questionnaire. 
		Please note that you can look at these instructions at any point in the game. 
  		<br />
