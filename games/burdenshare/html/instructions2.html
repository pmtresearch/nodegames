	<h1>Instructions of the experiment. Please read them carefully</h1>
	<div id="instructions">
		You will play a total of four rounds with each round following the same format. Each round will be played against one 
		other participant. In every pair, there will be one “proposer”, and a “responder”. Anyone can be a “responder” or a “proposer”. 
		These roles are randomly assigned to each player every round. You will be given the wealth of your one-person economy and how much 
		it has contributed to climate risk due to its economic growth in the past. Climate risk is the probability with which you can lose 
		a part of your wealth due to a climate catastrophe in the experiment. The wealth amongst players ranges between 30 
		(low economic growth) and 125 ECU (high economic growth). Your contribution to climate risk can be between 0 and 25 percent with 
		those who had higher economic growth in the past having larger contributions to climate risk. You will start each of the three 
		rounds with the same wealth and contribution to climate risk.
		<br />
		<br />
		At the start of each round, the proposer will be asked how much of the total cost she/he offers to pay. This offer has to be 
		a whole number between 0 and <font id="cost"></font>. After that, the responder will be asked whether she/he accepts or rejects the offer. 
		If the responder accepts and a climate agreement has been reach then each player’s share of the cost is subtracted from his/her wealth.
		<br />
		<br />
		If the responder rejects, there is no agreement and no costs have to be paid. However, there is a risk that a climate catastrophe 
		will occur. This risk is the sum of both players’ contribution to climate risk plus a baseline risk of 15 percent. (that means it 
		can be between 15% and 65%). If a catastrophe happens, each player loses half of his or her wealth. The computer 
		randomly determines whether the catastrophe occurs. In this case, each player loses half of his or her wealth.
