			This page shows you the result of this round. In the table you can see 
			how much the other player offered to pay, and whether you accepted this 
			offer or not. [If accept:] In this example, you accepted and thus no climate 
			catastrophe happened. Both of you had to pay their share of the total cost. 
			[If reject:] In this example, you rejected and the computer randomly determined 
			that a climate catastrophe happened/that no climate catastrophe happened. Because 
			of this, both of you lost half of their wealth/Because of this, both of you keep 
			all of your wealth from the beginning of this round. The table below shows how 
			much each of you have left at the end of this round.
