	<h1>Instructions of the experiment.</h1>
	<div id="instructions">
		In this game we will simulate climate change negotiations. The large majority of scientists agree that the main cause
		for global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxid (CO<sub>2</sub>). Each unit of 
		CO<sub>2</sub> emitted has the same effect on the Earth’s climate, regardless of where it has been emitted. If global warming continues 
		unchecked, there are likely to be catastrophic consequences that lead to heavy economic damage and human suffering.
		<br />
		<br />
		One of the major obstacles to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> is its cost and deciding how to share these costs amongst countries 
		and individuals. In this experiment, you will have to negotiate how to share the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
		In the game, we will use “Experimental Currency Units” (ECU). The total cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is 30 ECU. 
		<br />
		<br />
		You will play a total of four rounds with each round following the same format. Each round will be played against one 
		other participant. In every pair, there will be one “proposer”, and a “responder”. Anyone can be a “responder” or a “proposer”. 
		These roles are randomly assigned to each player every round. You will be given the wealth of your one-person economy and how much 
		it has contributed to climate risk due to its economic growth in the past. Climate risk is the probability with which you can lose 
		a part of your wealth due to a climate catastrophe in the experiment. The wealth amongst players ranges between 30 
		(low economic growth) and 125 ECU (high economic growth). Your contribution to climate risk can be between 0 and 25 percent with 
		those who had higher economic growth in the past having larger contributions to climate risk. You will start each of the three 
		rounds with the same wealth and contribution to climate risk.
		<br />
		<br />
		At the start of each round, the proposer will be asked how much of the total cost she/he offers to pay. This offer has to be 
		a whole number between 0 and 30. After that, the responder will be asked whether she/he accepts or rejects the offer. 
		If the responder accepts and a climate agreement has been reach then each player’s share of the cost is subtracted from his/her wealth.
		<br />
		<br />
		If the responder rejects, there is no agreement and no costs have to be paid. However, there is a risk that a climate catastrophe 
		will occur. This risk is the sum of both players’ contribution to climate risk plus a baseline risk of 15 percent. (that means it 
		can be between 15% and 65%). If a catastrophe happens, each player loses half of his or her wealth. The computer 
		randomly determines whether the catastrophe occurs. In this case, each player loses half of his or her wealth.  
		<br />
		<br />
		You will play four rounds. Each of these rounds is completely independent from the others, and you will start each 
		round again with the same wealth and contribution to climate risk. The first round is <b>PRACTICE</b>. The subsequent 
		three rounds will be used in the experiment. 
		At the end of the game, you will receive your remaining endowment from one of the last three rounds (in addition to 
		your fixed show-up fee). Which round will be paid out is randomly selected by the computer at the end of the game. 
		For your payout, 50 ECU equal 1 USD.
		<br />
		<br />
		After the game, there will be a short questionnaire. Your payment does not depend on your answers in the questionnaire. 
		Please note that you can look at these instructions at any point in the game.

		Please stick to the following rules during the experiment.
		<ul>
			<li>Always follow the instructions on the screen.</li>
			<li>Do not use the "Back Button" of your browser during the experiment.</li>
			<li>If you by mistake used the "Back Button" please follow the instructions on the opening page and click the "Continue" button.</li>
			<li>If your browser crashes you have 60 seconds to reconnect, otherwise the experiment will be terminated. 
				For reconnecting open the page again. You may now copy the internet adress you can see in the adress bar of your browser.</li>
		</ul>
		If you do not follow these rules we are unable to pay you out.
