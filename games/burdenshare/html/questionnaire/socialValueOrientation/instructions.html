<div class="questionExplanation">
	<p>In the upcoming section, you will make a series of decisions regarding allocations of points between you and another participant in the experiment.
	    <strong>This means the other participant is real!</strong> Both of you receive this same set of instructions.</p>
    <p>In the <strong>example</strong> below, a participant has chosen to distribute the points so that he or she receives 50 points, while the other participant receives 40 points.</p>
	<img border="0" src="example.png"><br>
	<p>As you can see, your choice will influence both the number of points you receive as well as the number of points someone else receives.
	    There are no right or wrong answers for this task. This is only a matter of your preference.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong class="red">NOTE that one of the six items will be randomly selected to be paid as part of your bonus and that of another participant.&nbsp;</strong>
    You will be paid the amount of points that you allocated to yourself in the implemented question and you will also receive the points that a different randomly selected participant allocated to the
        <i>Other</i> participant in their decision.</span></p>
