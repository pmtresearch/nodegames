	<h1>Instructions of the experiment. Please read them carefully</h1>
	<div id="instructions">
		In this game we will simulate climate change negotiations. The large majority of scientists agree that the main cause
		for global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxid (CO<sub>2</sub>). Each unit of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted has the same effect 
		on the Earth’s climate, regardless of where it has been emitted. If global warming continues unchecked, there are likely 
		to be catastrophic consequences that lead to heavy economic damage and human suffering.
		<br />
		<br />
		One of the major obstacles to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> is its cost and deciding how to share these costs amongst countries 
		and individuals. In this experiment, you will have to negotiate how to share the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
		In the game, we will use “Experimental Currency Units” (ECU). The total cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is <font id="cost"></font> ECU.
